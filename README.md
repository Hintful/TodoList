# TodoList
A React-based application that keeps track of user's To-do List, where user can interactively add or remove various tasks. Supports saving via local storage.



## Installation

Simply use the command `npm install` from the root working directory to install all the dependencies for this project.

Then use the command `npm start` to start-up the project locally at https://localhost:3000



## Implementation

React/JavaScript has been used mainly to create this application. After being exposed to React Hooks/Context API, this application has been made to experiment with the Hooks and Context APIs as much as possible. 

React Context API has been used for a couple of functionalities for this application including the main function of keeping track of the To-do Lists with `TodoContext`, paired with Reducer function created with React Hooks API, and also for allowing the overall color theme to be toggled between Light Theme and Dark Theme with `ThemeContext`.

Also, several React Hooks API functionalities have been utilized, including `useState()`, `useEffect()`, `useContext()`, and `useReducer()` in various parts of the application.



## Live Demo

Live demo of this application is available at my personal website: https://kurtchoi.dev/TodoList.
